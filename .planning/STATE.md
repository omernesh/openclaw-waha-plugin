## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Extract callWahaApi into http-client.ts (single chokepoint gives all 60+ functions reliability for free)
- [Roadmap]: Use lru-cache (npm) over custom LRU implementation for edge case handling
- [Roadmap]: Phase 2 and 3 can run in parallel after Phase 1 completes
- [01-01]: Used AbortSignal.timeout() for request timeouts instead of manual AbortController
- [01-01]: Custom TokenBucket implementation instead of external library
- [01-01]: Module-level shared backoff state for 429 responses

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: assertAllowedSession guardrail has been accidentally broken before -- needs careful rework with integration tests
- [Phase 3]: p-queue ESM compatibility with OpenClaw plugin loader unverified
- [Phase 4]: Gateway multi-session webhook routing model needs verification during planning
